1. Colombia

Context: Colombia remains the world’s largest coca and cocaine producer, with cultivation driven by rural poverty, armed groups, and high international demand. Conflict dynamics and corruption challenge enforcement efforts.
Policy: Colombia historically relied on forced eradication and U.S.-backed militarized approaches (e.g., Plan Colombia). Recently, the government has shifted toward a more humanitarian and development-oriented strategy — focusing on rural reform, crop substitution, and peace-building rather than aggressive eradication alone.

2. Peru

Context: Peru is the second-largest coca cultivator, with remote valleys central to production.
Policy: Peru uses a mix of eradication, alternative development projects, and security operations. It has strengthened cooperation with the U.S. and UNODC and increased air-interdiction measures but faces difficulties due to mountainous terrain and strong criminal networks.

3. Bolivia

Context: Bolivia has legally permitted coca cultivation for traditional purposes, but excess production feeds illicit markets.
Policy: Bolivia promotes “coca yes, cocaine no”, regulating licensed farmers while eradicating illegal crops. It opposes U.S.-style militarization and emphasizes sovereignty. The government works with UNODC for crop monitoring but resists external pressure for harsher eradication.

4. Mexico

Context: Mexico is a major hub for cocaine transit and synthetic drug production (especially fentanyl). Cartels operate as decentralized networks dominating areas of the country.
Policy: Mexico focuses on militarized internal security operations but faces criticism for human-rights concerns. It collaborates with the U.S. on precursor control, intelligence sharing, and border security. Current strategy leans toward financial targeting of cartels rather than capturing kingpins.

5. Ecuador

Context: Ecuador has transformed into a critical export platform for cocaine, especially through Guayaquil’s ports.
Policy: Ecuador focuses on port-security reforms and anti-corruption initiatives, works with UNODC’s PCCP program, and has increased the military presence in high-crime zones. The government is pushing for judicial reform due to cartel infiltration into state institutions.

6. Panama

Context: A major maritime chokepoint at the Panama Canal, heavily exploited for trafficking.
Policy: Panama prioritizes port-inspection technology, maritime patrol cooperation, and container-monitoring systems. It works closely with UNODC and the World Customs Organization. Anti-money-laundering laws have also been strengthened to combat criminal financing networks.

7. Guatemala

Context: A central land corridor with strong cartel presence and weak institutions.
Policy: Guatemala cooperates with both UNODC and U.S. agencies to improve border security, intelligence sharing, and corruption reduction. However, limited resources and political instability hinder long-term progress.

8. Honduras

Context: High levels of crime, corruption, and gang infiltration make Honduras a major transit point.
Policy: Recent administrations have increased extraditions of traffickers and expanded cooperation with U.S. and UNODC. The government is attempting institutional reforms but struggles with corruption within law enforcement.

9. Costa Rica

Context: Increasingly targeted by traffickers due to its long coastlines and strong transport infrastructure.
Policy: Costa Rica focuses on maritime patrols, intelligence-led policing, and regional cooperation. As a non-militarized country, it relies heavily on police forces and international partnerships.

10. Brazil

Context: A major South American export hub to Europe, particularly through ports like Santos.
Policy: Brazil emphasizes port inspections, border operations, and anti-money-laundering efforts. Domestically, drug policy debates surround decriminalization vs. strict enforcement. Brazil takes an active role in UNODC initiatives, especially CRIMJUST.

11. Dominican Republic

Context: A Caribbean transit bridge for cocaine toward North America and Europe.
Policy: The country invests in airport and seaport security with UNODC support. It also works with regional task forces and has expanded surveillance and container-control units.

12. Venezuela

Context: Political instability, porous borders, and presence of armed groups create conditions that facilitate trafficking.
Policy: Venezuela officially denies involvement in trafficking and emphasizes sovereignty. It supports multilateral, non-military cooperation but rejects unilateral interventions. Drug-policy structures weakened during political crises, though collaboration with UNODC continues at the technical level.

13. El Salvador

Context: Not a cocaine producer but heavily affected by gang-related trafficking and violence.
Policy: Government policy is centered on strict anti-gang crackdowns, expanded policing, and incarceration. Internationally, El Salvador supports regional cooperation but prioritizes domestic security first.

14. Argentina

Context: Used increasingly as a transit zone and money-laundering hub.
Policy: Argentina focuses on financial crimes, precursor regulation, and joint intelligence operations. It works actively with UNODC on transnational investigations via CRIMJUST.

15. Chile

Context: Strong institutions but growing vulnerability due to containerized shipping routes through ports like San Antonio and Valparaíso.
Policy: Chile implements robust border controls, invests in port scanning, and participates in regional intelligence sharing. It also works on domestic prevention programs as cocaine consumption increases.

16. United States

Context: Major destination market for cocaine, methamphetamine, and fentanyl.
Policy: U.S. drug policy combines law enforcement, interdiction, border control, and public health initiatives. It pressures Latin American partners to strengthen supply-side measures and is a primary donor to UNODC and regional anti-narcotics programs.

17. Canada

Context: Growing market for synthetic drugs and cocaine.
Policy: Canada balances enforcement with harm-reduction policies. It invests in public-health strategies (e.g., safe supply, treatment access) and supports UNODC globally with development-oriented funding.

21. China

Context: Key source of precursor chemicals used in synthetic drugs.
Policy: China strictly enforces chemical controls and collaborates with UNODC on precursor monitoring. It emphasizes sovereignty and rejects external pressure. Domestic drug laws are severe, with focus on enforcement and education.

22. Russia

Context: Faces domestic trafficking and consumption, mostly heroin and synthetic drugs.
Policy: Russia supports prohibition-based policies, strict law enforcement, and opposes drug decriminalization. It advocates for strong state-led initiatives and regional anti-trafficking operations.

23. France

Context: High cocaine demand and major entry via maritime routes.
Policy: France focuses on maritime interdiction, organized-crime dismantling, and expanding Europol cooperation. It also supports UNODC capacity-building in Latin America.
